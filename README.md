# IronOS custom firmware builds

Repo to host and archive my own [IronOS](https://github.com/Ralim/IronOS) builds. This repo is primarily for my devices, which are currently the following:
- Pine64 Pinecil v2
- Miniware TS101
- Sequre S60P
- Sequre T55 

The firmware builds for the other models are untested by me due to missing hardware. \
For flashing please refer the [IronOS flashing guide for your model](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/GettingStarted/)
